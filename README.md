# ML projects :-
## Overview
 **In this repository i have uploaded some mini Machine Learning projects using some important ML alogorithms.** <br>
 **These projects are made on  top of the libraries mentioned in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/MayukhBaruaha/Machine_Learning_Projects/blob/main/requirements.txt) file**
1. [Linear Regression](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/linear_regression.html)
2. [Logistic Regression](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logistic_regression.html)
3. **Support Vactor Machines** : <br>
